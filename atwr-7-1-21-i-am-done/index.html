You knew it. But we both didn't think it would be this early.</h2>
<p>For quite a long time now,, a little over two years, I've had a goal of being completely decentralized with my content and online prescence. I've had a few issues in accomplishing this goal and slowly over that time the ability to do this has trickled down into my brain.<br>
But the last couple of months that trickle has turned into a fast flowing faucet on how I can do this.</p>
<p>In the last month that fuacet has turned into a huge, high power fire hose!</p>
<h3 id="how-i-became-decentralized">How I became decentralized</h3>
<p>I started out checking into being &quot;self hostted&quot; or &quot;federated &quot; social media and website apps. Which, dont get me wrong, they really are great and have a place in being decentralized. But the inherrant problem is that they must be self hosted by you. True you can join someone els's instance and all good right? Wrong. It still requires you to put some amount of trust in someone else to maintaine that instance with security. And the problem with those federated platforms is they still require the old tried and true methods of functioning. The easy attack parameters of databases and such. Just like the old Web2.0 standard. BLOATED!</p>
<p>Then I ran across blockchain social media, specificly Steem and it's newly born brother Hive. That was when it hi me that it's not just the web that needs to be decentralized. It's your identity that needs to be as well. Hive changed my thought process and made it easer for me to understand this concept.</p>
<p>Once that happend I embraced but still continued to hold on to stuff. Twitter, web hosting, podcast audio/video media hosting and distribution and of course live streaming. I've seen IPFS before and honestly didnt think it was for me. Most of the time I am on the go and couldnt really set up a node on the laptop. Then it would only be accesible on the weekends when I was home. It kinda defeated the purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;But you could use Pinata or another similar service.&quot; True! But then there is that whole paying for it thing that I'm currently unable to do. So I put it on the back burner and just stayed the course.</p>
<p>About 6-8 months I ran across <a href="https://d.buss">Dbuzz</a> which is a Twitter like front end for Hive. Then came the announcement of []3Speaks desktop app](<a href="https://github.com/3speaknetwork/3Speak-app/releases/tag/v0.1.12">https://github.com/3speaknetwork/3Speak-app/releases/tag/v0.1.12</a>) that will use IPFS for storage and distribution. And then I heard about a project called []Aureal](<a href="https://aureal.one">https://aureal.one</a>) which is like 3Speak or Dtube but for audio podcasts. I was a quick adopter of Aureal. Whose main goal is to be an app that people can create, produce and distrubute a podcast similar to Anchor. But being decentralized and using Hive for payment to the podcaster and not taking a cent from them for it!</p>
<p>After watching them and working with them some over the last several months they are very very close to a huge release and announcement. I'm talking this will be within about a month or so. They are going to release LIVE rooms that you can stream to while recording. And it will have a restream capability to stream to other places such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. All from your mobile phone! That just blows my mind!</p>
<h3 id="the-final-straw-that-is-making-me-flip-the-switch-on-the-final-end-game">The final straw that is making me flip the switch on the final end game.</h3>
<p>As you know I was looking into IPFS again and the tech has improved immensly over the last two years. You can now use IPNS to pin a regular domain to it. You can even distribute large files such as video easily. You can even do live streaming over it.<br>
After learning all that out I thought I should take another look at DTube since they've been into distributing videos using Bit Torrent and IPFS for awhile now. Thats when I ran across the OndLoveIPFS uploader. I did some reading up on it and saw that it can post to Hive, Steem and Avalon (Dtube's blockcjain). One of the requirements was that you needed your own IPFS node. Which conviently had for a month or so since I was playing with it. But then I made the fatal mistake.</p>
<p>I installed it.</p>
<p>I FELL IN LOVE! The thing is that it is video and I'm an audio guy. But with a little persistence from the OneLoveDtube community (specicly Dook13). I figured out some ffmpeg commands to create videos from my audio podcasts. So this will fill a major component in my goal. Decentralized audio/video distribution. I can now be 90-95% decentralized. When Aureal releases it's LIVE rooms I will do one final episode created and distributed with Anchor and then I will never login to it again.</p>
<p>I am going to slowly start posting my video content over at DTube. Not anything against 3 Speak. I think their hearts are in the right place in the adoption of Web 3.0. But, I actually didnt realize this and only learned of it very recently. But in order to post on 3Speak.TV you have to give them permission to post under their keys. Thats not decentralized. I do believe that their desktop app will be different in the final stage. Since it will be focussed more on using the Speak netwrok than on just Hive.</p>
<p>Which leads me back to the OneLoveIPFS uploader. It's goals are very similar. It's just a tool that can be used to post to multiple bloackchains at once. And uses your own IPFS node to do it. This is MAJOR deal for content creators!!!</p>
<p>Want to be decntralized, <strong>OWN</strong> your content, <strong>OWN</strong> your distribution methods and <strong>OWN</strong> your rewards system? It is possible, right now! <strong>I mean TODAY!</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do is flip  the switch and make it happen!</p>
<h3 id="to-sum-it-all-up">To sum it all up</h3>
<p>I am going ahead and flipping the switch on everything except for the Loud &amp; Proud Show. That will remain as it is. Why? Because there are other hosts on the show as well as it it tied in pretty tightly with MSPWaves. I will not make any changes on it since there are so many others that need to be involved in it.</p>
<p>But her is the list of coming changes for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter will be replaced by DBuzz. It already is for the most part. But I do tend to utilize the the &quot;send to twtiter button&quot; on it. But the main difference is that I will no longer log into Twitter to actively interact with comments or retweets. I'm done with Twatter's BS.</li>
<li>As soon as Aureal launches live rooms and hosting of media files through IPFS I will stop using Anchor. Which meanss that RSS feed to all the podcast directories will die a painful but needed death. In order to get my podcasts you will either have to use the feed from Aureal or catcgh them on DTube. Which segways nicely into the next bullet point.</li>
<li>All of my future videos will be posted utilizing the OneLoveIPFS uploader. While I can still post videos to Hive they will stop showing on 3Speak's website 3Speak.tv. Once the OneLoveIPFS uploader works in Speak network they will then show up in the 3Speak desktop app. Which I am fine with. I have 80 videos over there and 107 followers. Which I would like to invite all 107 or you to come over to DTube and follow me there. You will get all the same great content from there as you did on 3Speak.</li>
<li>My website/blog will no longer be a regular website. It will be on IPFS only. So it should be accesible through any normal Firefox, Brave or Opera browsers now that they seem to be supporting it. It most likely will still look the same. And I am changing the domain unklebonehead.xyz to point to the IPNS. I already have it pinned on Pinata and it is also pinned by some other people I belive.  Interesting side note. The other day I was connected to over 1000 peers around the world. The last time I checked out IPFS was a year or so ago and the only peers I found were around 350. So take those numbers for growth rate. IPFS really is the future and one of the keys of Web 3.0.</li>
